that [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") created for providing [shared access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_access "Shared access") to [files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file") and [printers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing) "Printer (computing)") across [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking) "Node (networking)") on a network.
- It also provides an authenticated [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication "Inter-process communication") (IPC) mechanism.
- SMB relies on the [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") and [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") protocols for transport


# NetBIOS

acronym for **Network Basic Input/Output System**


provides services related to the [session layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_layer "Session layer") of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model") allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a [local area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network")

Simply saying, it is a protocol that allows communication of files and printers through the Session Layer of the OSI Model in a LAN.[_[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_
