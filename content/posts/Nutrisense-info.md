# Understanding Traditional Glucose Values


While fasting levels are important to monitor and keep within range, postprandial (after eating) glucose levels are better correlated with overall health. Recent studies have shown that when postprandial glucose levels consistently stay above 140 mg/dL, we start to see an increased risk for many types of disease. ==This measurement is performed approximately 2-3 hours after a meal, and the _ideal_ range is between 70-100 mg/dL==. ==As a general rule, aim to have postprandial values lower than 140 mg/dL, and as close to your pre-meal levels as possible==.

This makes the two difficult to compare at any point when your glucose levels are fluctuating (==the best time to compare CGM readings to finger stick readings is first thing in the morning before you have eaten or done any sort of exercise==).
