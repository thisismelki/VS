.rc originally stood "run commands" they run before using a application, program/operating system.

Designed to setup the application, program/operating system with what the user preferences are so they do not have to set them up on another machine again.

Most common encountered .rc file in the wild is the .bashrc and also .zshrc files. 



Not very accurate but an easy way to show famous rc files in Linux
```bash
find /etc/ -name 'rc*' or -name '*rc'


```
