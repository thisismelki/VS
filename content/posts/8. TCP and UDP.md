# 3 Way-Handshake 
Connection oriented
- TCP
- Reliable Deliviery 

Clients send SYN
# TCP Details
- windows size = How much can be sent before ack
- Retransmission = Packet resent
- Sequence number: unique identifier for each packet
	- Good for unreliable or congested networks


Half-duplex networks produced collisions, resulting in packet loss.

Connectionless
- UDP
- No acknowledgments, ordering, or duplication protection
- Transmits faster than TCP
